# Facebook Sound Kit

## What is this?

To help designers explore how sound can impact their designs, Facebook Design created a collection of interaction sounds for prototypes. Two folders are included in this download: "Full Volume" and "Low Volume". Each has a variety of sounds that are identical to each other with one difference being the default volume.

**Full Volume (-5dB)**
We use this set of sounds when playing back on our computers. Use this sound set for times when you need more control over volume. These files are loud and will most likely need to be turned down. For example, if you are giving a demonstration on your laptop, you may need to adjust your computer or system volume to suit your playback needs.

**Low Volume (-20dB)**
We use this set of sounds when playing back on a mobile device and are closer to the sounds you might find in production. Use this sound set when you would like playback to be more representative of how experiences might sound on a mobile device. The files are much lower in volume which can help with speaker distortion. For example, each mobile device has on board DSP (Digital Signal Processing), which can impact audio playback. Playing back sounds at lower levels may help alleviate this OS challenge as you iterate.

## File Structure

The name of each file is intended to help make it easier to know where to use these sounds. However, we encourage you to swap assets in and out and have fun as you explore. Each parent folder includes subfolders with the following categories of assets:

**Buttons and Navigation**
These sounds are short and simplistic. They may be helpful if you need to provide tactile feedback as a person navigates an experience.

**Complete and Success**
These sound may be useful when reinforcing unique moments within apps such as completing an action or approving a request. Adding more delight in this case can help support positive feedback.

**Errors and Cancel**
These sounds can communicate if interactions do not complete or when a person navigates back to a previous tab or state.

**Notifications and Alerts**
When action is needed within an app or if important information needs to be communicated while the app is in the background, higher signal sounds may help draw attention. These sounds are in some cases more high signal or more colorful and provide additional feedback.
